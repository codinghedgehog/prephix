Prephix (Pre-Phrecon Input fiXer)

Usage: prephix.pl k28.out_file1 [k28.out_file2 ...] -batchid <id> [-debug] [-quiet] [-exclude <loci_file>] [-ignore_quality]

Takes in a list of input files and generates one SNP loci output file (containing multiple strains), one reference base file,
and a file containing the excluded indel entries.

The indel file is formated as "STRAIN ID" [TAB] k28|nuc|vcf [TAB] ...excluded VAAL K28, VCF, or NUCMER line...
So prephix basically dumps the excluded lines as-is into the indel file, but prefixes each line
with the strain id and then either k28 for VAAL formatted line, nuc for NUCMER formatted line, or vcf for VCF formatted line.

The SNP loci and reference base files are suitable as input to the phrecon (Phylo Reconstructor) utility (i.e. tab
delimited columnar format: STRAIN_ID [TAB] LOCI [TAB] BASE).

The SNP loci file and indel files are suitable input for the SNP Swapper utility.

Recognized input file formats: k28.out (VAAL), NUCMER, VCF

You may mix input file types within a single run/batch.
